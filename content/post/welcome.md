## Your Garden
This digital garden is your special place on the internet. It is powered
by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## What to do next ?
Here are a few things you can do with your new garden:

1. Checkout the latest version of the source from codecommit [here (http)]({codecommit_http}) or [here (ssh)]({codecommit_ssh})
2. Customize the look and feel of your anatole themed garden (link to [documentation](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/)). 
3. Deploy new live content on your garden by committing to the master branch.
